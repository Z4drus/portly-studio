# Repository instructions

## Development servers

- Always use Portly (`portly ...`) to start, stop, restart, inspect, or keep local development servers running.
- Start with `portly status`. Use `portly status --details` only for the full inventory and metrics, and `--json` only for machine-readable fields. Reuse a healthy managed server; if an in-scope server is running outside Portly, register it and use `portly take-over <project/server> --json`.
- For long-lived or reusable work, create a project and server.
- For builds, tests, code generation, and other bounded one-off work, run it directly in the foreground with a timeout; Portly only supervises servers.
- Never launch persistent development servers directly, in the background, or through another supervisor.
